D. Guerilla Testing Feedback

1. Summarize qualitative feedback
	After collecting feedback regarding the wireframe, several ideas were proposed to update the design to its current state. The first feedback was to add some calls to action on the website. This would draw a user’s attention and help the business case by getting more people to visit the island. This actionable item would be a good addition to the design. Another actionable item is to add some links to social media. Social media is a large part of tourism advertising and would be another good addition as people can easily see pictures and experiences they could enjoy if they visit. One piece of unanimous feedback was the inclusion of a search bar to search the site for specific information if a user is looking for something specific. This is also an actionable item and can be added to the design. One more item that would be actionable and relevant to the design was the suggestion that a contact form would be a positive addition. This would allow users to provide their contact information to receive newsletters or promotional material. 
	Other items brought up in guerilla usability testing include adding contact information for the tourism board or business hosting the website. This information isn’t present now and was not part of the information collected, so it is not actionable. Another bit of feedback received was to add video elements to introduce the island in some way. This is also not actionable right now. There is no media available for the website or prototype, so it will not be something that can be included. 
	
2. Explain how this feedback will be incorporated into the project
	The prototype design will utilize the feedback received through guerilla usability testing. The actionable items will be evaluated and added to the website’s design. All the feedback given can help add more features and make the website more user-friendly. The focus will be those actionable items: adding calls to action, social media links, search bar, and contact forms. Calls to action will be placed as active statements that draw user attention. These can be incorporated as links that pull the user to book travel and reservations or commit to events on the island. Social media links will be added as links, allowing users to access the associated sites and pages that display the island. The search bar will be added to the navigation section. The contact form will be simple and added to the footer section so that it is present on every page the user visits. This maximizes the chance that users will see the contact form and feel they should sign up for more information. 
E. Build a Prototype of the Website
